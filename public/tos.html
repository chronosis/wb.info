<h2>Terms of Service</h2>
<h4>Content</h4>
<p>I'll draw just about any kinks; I'm fine with a lot of stuff many artists tend to avoid, so if what you want isn't in the ranges listed below, go ahead and ask. If you want something within these ranges, please don't ask or try to figure out right where "the line" is to try and ride it. These aren't up for debate or negotiation, but if you want to know more detailed "why not?" about anything below, feel free to check my FAQ.</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><b>Will not draw</b>:
<ul>
  <li><b>Surprise/Gift art</b> - I will not use any individual's Original Characters/fursonas without their permission in advance or their presence in-stream at the time the image is being drawn</li>
  <li><b>Poop/fart/filth/stink/vomit/diapers</b> - WS is fine, musk ≠ stink, cum from the mouth ≠ vomit</li>
  <li><b>Females/feminized/crossdressing males</b> - not good at it/not interested in doing it</li>
  <li><b>non-binary genders</b> - don't want to "get it wrong" and insult/offend/"misrepresent" somebody</li>
  <li><b>"poz"/hiv-positive characters</b> - another minefield I prefer to just avoid </li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4>My Rights</h4>
<p>I retain all rights to the artwork and my characters. I have the right to post and share the artwork wherever I wish, to use cropped portions of the artwork in other works such as banners or advertisements, to include the artwork in portfolio collections, prints, artbooks, and any other commercial use, both digital and physical merch, as I see fit. I may at any point do additional work on a commission if I wish; ink a sketch, color, shade, or have someone else color the image. </p>
<h4>Your Rights</h4>
<p>You retain all rights to your characters. You have the right to post and share the unaltered artwork wherever you wish, or to use cropped portions of the artwork as an icon or banner, etc. You may not use the artwork for any commercial or third-party purpose without my consent and compensation agreed upon. You may color uncolored linework yourself if you wish, but you must get my permission before asking anyone other than yourself to color my linework. Any other alteration of the artwork must be authorized by me <em>before</em> the alteration is made.</p>
<h4>Caveats</h4>
<p>If I or another artist of my choosing colors a commission that was only for black and white lineart, I will do my best to either ask for references or use the references given during the initial commission process to ensure accuracy, but if a commission receives work beyond the level that was actually paid for (free additional upgrade), corrections will only be considered for particularly egregious inaccuracies ("my fur is blue, not yellow" = yes, "my fur&nbsp; is pantone 2144c not 2175c" = no). </p>
<p>I don't do "secret" or "private" commissions where I am restricted in how or where I post/share what I've drawn. If you REALLY want something from me but want me to waive my rights of distribution and re-use, you need to come at me with an offer of at least 5 times whatever your commission would normally cost before I'm even going to consider it. That's not me being greedy, it's just setting the bar of how much I just do not want to do "private" work.</p>
<p>In the event of any interpersonal drama or falling-out with someone you were previously included in artwork with, I am under no obligation to alter, remove, take down, delete, or otherwise eliminate from any of my galleries or archives said artwork. </p>
<p>If you do not notice an error with your commission until after the completed artwork is delivered and approved, it is entirely at my discretion whether or not to go back and make corrections. The more recent the commission was and the more significant the error, the more likely I will make the correction. If a drawing was from a live stream session and you left, or agreed to a slot where your presence was not required, only the most significant of errors will be considered for correction. </p>
<p>Your character's presence in an image does not grant you any rights to the artwork beyond those outlined in "Your Rights" above, nor does it grant me any rights to use your character in any additional artwork wihout your consent. The rights to <em>my characters</em> and the <em>image</em> are mine, even if your character is in it, but the rights to your <em>character</em> are still yours.</p>
<h4>Legal Age</h4>
<p>You must be over 18 to commission me, even if the work you wish to commission is not adult in nature.</p>
<h4>Payment</h4>
<p>I accept Square and Paypal, with Square greatly preferred. Once I've accepted your commission, I will send you instructions for payment. I will not begin work until I've been paid in full. <strong>Do not send payment before I instruct you to do so.</strong> Payment sent to someone who hasn't agreed to do work for you isn't a commission, it's a donation. </p>
<h4>Refunds</h4>
<p>You may request a refund at any time before the work is completed, for any reason. If any work has been done on your commission, or if a delivery time was agreed upon and that time has not been reached, a base minimum of 25% will be kept for time spent in initial correspondence to arrange/organize/schedule the commission, with an additional percentage retained based on the amount of work done. A full refund will only be delivered if an agreed-upon deadline has passed and/or no work has been done on your commission. Extenuating circumstances may be considered at my discretion. If funds are not available for an immediate refund at the time of the request (as is going to almost always be the case - I'm not sitting on fat stacks of furry cock money as may be assumed), you will be placed in a refund queue and paid as soon as the funds become available. No refund request will be considered after the work is completed.</p>
<h4>Refusal</h4>
<p>I reserve right to decline a commission, request, or third party inclusion of anyone, at any time, for any reason.</p>
<p>These terms may be updated without notice at any time. By commissioning, requesting, or otherwise agreeing to your character(s) being in art from me, you accept these terms as posted at the time of the agreement.</p>
