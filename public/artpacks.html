<h2>Annual Art Packs</h2>
<p>
  Every year, I release an Annual Art Pack of my work. These are available for digital download purchase at any time. All prices are USD.<br /><br />

  2016 is $35 for 240 images, plus 20 colors by others - and as a bonus, the old Oh, Brother! comic in high res.<br />
  2015 is $30 for 272 images, plus 35 colors by others,<br />
  2014 is $25 for <strong>480 images</strong>, plus 35 colors by others,<br />
  2013 is $20 for 270 pics plus 21 colors by others,<br />
  2012 is $20 for 370 pics plus 57 colors by others,<br />
  2011 is $20 for 336 images plus <strong>150+ colors by others</strong>.<br /><br />

  The Wolfblade Decade pack is $25 for <strong>over 1,000 images</strong> from 2000 to 2010,
  and a few really ancient crappy things even older than that. Nearly all Wolfblade art ever posted online (and a bunch that never were) up to the end of 2010 is on this cd.<br /> <br />

<a class="gumroad-button" href="https://gum.co/EjJoL" target="_blank">Buy Wolfblade Decade Pack</a>

  If you get more than one Pack, I knock 5 bucks off the total for each additional pack (buy two, get 5 bucks off, buy three, 10 bucks off, etc).
  So if you get all of them, you're getting the whole first decade of my stuff for free.
  The Whole Shebang would be $145, for 15+ years and over 3000 images of big, fat, spurting, throbbing, gay-as-fuck male/male furry porn.
  <strong>ALSO: supporters of <a class="auto_link" href="https://www.patreon.com/Wolfblade">my Patreon</a> at the $40 Champion level or above get an additional $10 off the total when buying The Whole Shebang.</strong><br /> <br />

  If you're interested, send me an <strong>email</strong> to poorwolfy at gmail dot com (the email address stamped on all my art, guys) with "ART PACK" in the email subject. Include in the email your paypal email address (if different from the address you are emailing from), an age statement, and which pack(s) you want.
  <strong>If you're a patron, be sure to mention that and your Patreon username if buying The Whole Shebang.</strong>
  I can also take payments via Square/Cash (SUPER freakin simple and useful, you should totally look into it if you don't have that already).
  I will send you an invoice, and you'll receive an automated email with a download link shortly after that is paid.<br />

  <strong>Note: Due to recurring issues with Yahoo and Hotmail rejecting the automated emails, I will need an email address that is neither Hotmail or Yahoo in order to send you the art packs.</strong> <br /> <br />

  Big Thanks to everyone who helps support me, whether you're an old fan or just stumbling onto me!
